# student-feedback-system
It was my final year project, where I developed an online student feedback system for the college. The system takes the feedback from students about the lectures, subject, the instructor's teaching style etc. in an easy and quick manner. The feedback consists of 3 questionnaire form. After taking feedback from the students, the system generates report under different categories, which can be viewed in the form of pie chart and also can be printed.
